  <h3>Unturned is the one of the best rated games in the steam store as of December 2nd, 2016.</h3>
   <h3>The game starts by dropping the player off on a map of their choice; whether Prince Edward Island (PEI), Yukon, Washington, Russia, or a custom one made by the community, or the player.[2] With nothing in their possession, players must find weapons to survive against zombies as well as find supplies to keep from dying of starvation, thirst, disease, or in the case of Yukon and other winter maps, cold. The game has three difficulty levels. In the first difficulty level, Easy, loot spawns are 50% greater than the game's next difficulty setting, Normal. On this setting, there are standard spawns and nothing added or subtracted. And Hard, where loot spawns are decreased along with higher zombie damage. In Unturned 2.0, there was a similar gamemode, Hardcore. It had a variety of changes, including some of the GUI being removed, and various things were made harder. In Gold mode, special cosmetic options for the character and interface are unlocked.</h3>
   <h3>As the player progresses through the game, they gain experience points from killing zombies or gathering resources which can then be used for skills boosts and an expansive crafting menu. These skills can affect simple things, such as doing more damage with either a melee weapon or ranged weapon, to increasing vitality or lowering the rate at which the player dehydrates or starves or their ability of farming or cooking over a fire to not starve. Random Boosts are somewhat random abilities, such as an increased throwing range, or triggering a velocity boost on corpses every time you kill zombies, players and animals.</h3>

<h3>Unturned also includes a multiplayer gamemode. Server owners may modify the server settings, some of which are shared with single-player, while other settings are exclusive to the game-mode. These include the enabling or disabling the ability to have player versus player combat, allowing players to sync their character data between servers, putting up server plugins such as shops, or kits, and setting a maximum capacity for players. While server admins can kick/ban abusive players. Ports were added for private server hosting.</h3	>
